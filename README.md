## Solving the Roli Connect Driver or Installation Error on Windows

Firstly, open `Task Manager` and end any tasks called `ROLI Connect` or `ROLI Hardware Driver`. If you don’t do this, you won’t be able to remove Connect completely.

Next, **delete the files and folders listed below**. If the file or folder doesn't exist, move on to the next step.
*Anytime USERNAME is referenced, you must replace that with your Windows username (see this in C:\Users).*

- C:\Program Files\ROLI\ROLI Connect
- C:\Program Files\ROLI\ROLI Hardware Driver
- C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\ROLI
- C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\ROLI Connect
- C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\rpkg
- C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\roli-hub-updater

Once you've deleted the files and folders listed above, please head to [roli.com/start](https://roli.com/start) and follow the instructions to install ROLI Connect afresh.
